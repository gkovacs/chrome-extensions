# chrome-extensions

These are some personal chrome extensions I use in packed (crx) form, to avoid the sideloaded extension warning each time I start up Chrome. (I would upload them to the Chrome store but they keep getting rejected without providing any reason).

To install, go to chrome://extensions and then drag-and-drop the .crx file onto the page.
