# chrome-extensions

These are some personal chrome extensions I use in packed (crx) form, to avoid the sideloaded extension warning each time I start up Chrome. (I previously had them hosted on the Chrome store but they were removed without providing any reason, and received no response when appealing the removal, so hosting them on GitHub is my next best option).

To install, go to chrome://extensions and then drag-and-drop the .crx file onto the page.

## ichrome

This is a version of iChrome modified to incorporate vocabulary learning features on the new tab page
